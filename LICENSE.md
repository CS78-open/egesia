(private use, fair use, etc.) or related rights, or other applicable exceptions
to copyright protection.

3. Scope of the Licence

This Licence is granted for the term of the applicable copyright or related
rights from the date of the Distribution of the Work, or from the date of the
acceptance of this Licence by the Licensee, should that date precede the
Distribution.

This Licence covers the Work in all its forms of expression. Unless specified
otherwise by the Licensor, the provision of source code is a condition of this
Licence.

This Licence does not extend to any trademark or patent rights of the Licensor
and Contributors.

Any rights in the Work not expressly granted to You under this Licence are
reserved to the Licensor.

4. Obligations of the Licensee

The Licence is subject to Your compliance with the following conditions:

   – Attribution: You shall keep any copyright, patent or trademark notices,
     and all disclaimers that are attached to the Work and to its Derivative Works.
     You shall give any other recipient of the Work or of the Derivative Work
     a copy of the Licence and the disclaimer of warranty. When You communicate
     to the public the Work or a Derivative Work, You shall add a visible
     copyright notice to Your work, as well as a reference to the Licence,
     or to the repository where the Work is available, if applicable.
   – Compatibility: If You create a Derivative Work, or if You accept
     Contributions to the Work, You may distribute such Derivative Work or
     Contributions under this Licence, or under a compatible Licence.
     “Compatible Licence” means the licences listed in Annex 1 of this Licence.

either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranty of non-infringement,
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the
quality and performance of the Work is borne by You. Should the Work prove
defective, You assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

6. Liability

The Licensor shall not be liable to You for any damages, including direct,
indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, arising out of
the use or inability to use the Work, including, without limitation, damages for
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof,
and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise)
upon which the claim is based.
